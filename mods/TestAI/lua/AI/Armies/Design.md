Plan for armies:

- An Army can request units, and uses those units.
- An Army might be Interceptors/ASF for the whole map; a land/naval force for a zone; or a localized land force for a proxy
- Units can be reassigned between armies (taken by an army with a higher priority)
- The static part of the base class will watch for units, and adjust assignments to maximize value

- The recruiter handles construction decisions
