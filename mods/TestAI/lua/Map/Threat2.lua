-- Doing generalized threat is great, but there are specific things I want to be different about each threat type
-- Bombers shouldn't significantly affect what we're willing to do with land if inty cover is available
-- Air units need to consider inties high movement before committing to somewhere



-- Really want radar cover; ground based AA is quite a lot worse without it
-- Shielded Flak is very strong
